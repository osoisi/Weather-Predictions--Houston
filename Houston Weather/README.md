# Weather Predictions
## Houston Airport Data Weather Project
This project aims to provide accurate weather predictions for the city of Houston, Texas.

## Project Overview
The project uses a Python notebook to read CSV data downloaded from the NCDC weather website, preprocess it, and visualize it using Matplotlib and Seaborn. 

### Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from Houston's airport, specifically focusing on key weather variables such as wind speed, pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind direction. This data is crucial for understanding the local weather patterns and making accurate predictions.
